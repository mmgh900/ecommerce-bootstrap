Carrow is a responsive e-commerce platform that I developed for PaykanPars to showcase my frontend development skills. The platform was built using Bootstrap components, and features an easy-to-use interface for customers to purchase car parts at the wholesaling level. As the sole developer on the project, I designed and implemented the frontend using Next.js, React, and Redux.

My goal for this project was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly e-commerce platform that would provide a seamless experience for PaykanPars' customers. The platform was designed to be fully responsive, allowing customers to easily navigate and purchase products from any device.

Overall, Carrow was a great opportunity for me to showcase my frontend development skills, and I'm proud of the result I was able to achieve in just one month.
